# search
Multi-functional CLI script that allows you to search for a term in a directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NSPC911/scripts
```

Coming Soonâ„¢ onto [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)

Add the folder to environment path before attempting to search for items

Currently tested on Windows. Linux and MacOS testers are welcome.

Run `search --help` for a list of commands

There is currently only one easter egg error. You will need to enable `easter_errors` in `search.config.json` or run `search --config set easter_errors true` and do quite a bit of experimenting (or just use search to search where i check for easter_errors to print the error) to print it.
