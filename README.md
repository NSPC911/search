# search
Multi-functional CLI script that allows you to search for a term in a directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NSPC911/scripts
```

Coming Soon™ onto [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)

Add the folder to environment path before attempting to search for items

Compatible on most systems (I believe so, have not tested.)

Config is yet to be configable through search itself and requires changing the json file itself.
