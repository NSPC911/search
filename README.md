# search
Multi-functional CLI script that allows you to search for a term in a directory.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/NSPC911/scripts
```

Coming Soonâ„¢ onto [Scoop](https://scoop.sh)

Add the folder to environment path before attempting to search for items

Compatible on most systems (I believe so, have not tested.)
